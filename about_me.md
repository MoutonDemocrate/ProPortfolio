I'm **Laérian**, a 20 years old student in computer science at the **ENSEEIHT** School of Toulouse in France. I specialise in **object-oriented programming**, **software engineering**, and **language theory**.

I started my journey with **shell scripting** on the family's Linux computer at the age of 9, to make small text-based games. I soon discovered Scratch, then **Python**, which is the language I now know the most. I since learned **C++**, **C**, **C#**, **Ada**, **Java**, **GDScript** and I am currently learning **Rust** and **Julia**.

While I have not professional experience **yet**, I took part in many **team projects** including [Drehmal](https://drehmal.net), a game for which I have made **models**, **animations** and a **standalone installer** using the free and open-source **Godot Engine**.
