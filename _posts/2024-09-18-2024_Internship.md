# Using Blender's image rendering to test 3D reconstruction algorithms

{: style="text-align: justify" }
During my Sophomore/M1 year at the ENSEEIHT, I completed my 6 weeks of internship at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute), where I was in charge of making renders of models with different light angles to test a new 3D reconstruction algorithm without having to build a prototype based only on theory.

During my internship, I had to :
- Create a new Ubuntu container to properly set up AMD's rendering libraries and drivers on my computer
- Use Blender's Python Scripting to procedurally generate images of reconstructed archeological artifacts 
- Modeling new objects using Blender's procedural suite
- Assembling procedural noise to create brand new textures for the algorithm
