# Making a game with people from all around the world

Drehmal is a video game using Minecraft as its engine, giving players a lot of freedom when interacting with the world.

I started participating to this project as a builder in 2021, but then was "promoted" to model artist and animator of the team. In 2023, I started working on an official modlist for Drehmal's new version, and also started developing a full standalone installer using Godot 4.

This project has significantly altered the way I work in a team. Having to coordinate work for a 20+ people organisation for 3 years taught me how to use tools like GitHub or Discord with maximum efficiency, but also how to communicate more clearly and efficiently, how to give feedback and how to receive it, and how to exchange information correctly during larger meetings.

### The project's website is hosted at >[drehmal.net](https://www.drehmal.net/)< is you are interested to see what we have made !
